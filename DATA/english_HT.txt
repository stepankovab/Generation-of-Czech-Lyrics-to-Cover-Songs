We don't talk about Bruno
no
no
no
We don't talk about Bruno

but It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin
Thunder

You telling this story or am I
I'm sorry mi vida go on
Bruno says "It looks like rain"
Why did he tell us
In doing so he floods my brain

Abuela get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day
but anyway

We don't talk about Bruno
no
no
no
We don't talk about Bruno

Hey
grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand

A seven-foot frame rats along his back
When he calls your name it all fades to black
Yeah he sees your dreams
and feasts on your screams

We don't talk about Bruno
no
no
no
We don't talk about Bruno

He told me my fish would die
the next day dead
He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said
He said that all my hair would disappear
now look at my head
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised
and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow Like the grapes
that thrive on the vine

He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now

Hey sis
I want not a sound out of you
It's like I can hear him now
I can hear him now

Um Bruno
Yeah about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Gimme the truth and the whole truth Bruno

And I'm fine
and I'm fine
and I'm fine
I'm fine

He's here
Don't talk about Bruno
Why did I talk
about Bruno
Not a word about Bruno
I never shoulda brought up Bruno
==========
I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust
of the earth is

I move mountains
I move churches
And I glow
'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is

Got a rough
indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum
I find 'em I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded but

Under the surface
I feel berserk
as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like “Yo
I don't wanna fight Cerberus”

Under the surface
I'm prеtty sure I'm worthless
if I can't be of sеrvice

A flaw or a crack
The straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back What breaks the camel's back

It's pressure like a drip
drip
drip
that'll never stop

Pressure that'll tip
tip
tip
'til you just go pop

whoa-uh-uh Give it to your sister
your sister's older
Give her all
the heavy things we can't shoulder

Who am I if I can't
run with the ball
If I fall to

Pressure like a grip
grip
grip
and it won't let go

Pressure like a tick
tick
tick
'til it's ready to blow

whoa-uh-uh Give it to your sister
your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't
carry it all
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens I worry something is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
Under the surface
I think about my purpose
Can I somehow preserve this

Line up the dominoes
A light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling
But on and on it goes
But wait

If I could shake
the crushing weight
Of expectations would that free some room up for joy Or relaxation

Or simple pleasure
Instead we measure
this growing pressure
Keeps growing keep going
'Cause all we know is

Pressure like a drip
drip
drip
that'll never stop

Pressure that'll tip
tip
tip
'til you just go pop

Give it to your sister it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and
bends but never breaks
No mistakes

just Pressure like a grip
grip
grip
and it won't let go

Pressure like a tick
tick
tick
'til it's ready to blow

Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes

No cracks
no breaks
No mistakes
No pressure
==========
Don't be upset or mad at all
Don't feel regret
or sad at all
Hey I'm still a part of the family Madrigal

And I'm fine
I am totally fine
I will stand on the side as you shine
I'm not fine
I'm not fine

I can't move the mountains
I can't make the flowers bloom
I can't take another night
Up in my room Waiting on a miracle

I can't heal what's broken
Can't control the morning rain or a hurricane
Can't keep down the
unspoken invisible pain
Always waiting on a miracle
a miracle

Always walking alone
Always wanting for more
Like I'm still at that door
Longing to shine
like all of you shine

All I need is a change
All I need is a chance
All I know is I can't

Stay on the side
Open your eyеs
Open your eyes
Opеn your eyes

I would move the mountains
Make new trees and flowers grow
Someone please just let me know
Where do I go
I am waiting on a miracle
A miracle

I would heal what's broken
Show this family something new
Who I am inside
So what can I do
I'm sick of waiting on a miracle
So here I go

I am ready
Come on I'm ready
I’ve been patient and steadfast and steady
Bless me now as you blessed us all those years ago
When you gave us a miracle
Am I too late for a miracle
==========
I just made something unexpected
Something sharp
Something new
It's not symmetrical or perfect
But it's beautiful
And it's mine
What else can I do

Bring it in
bring it in
Good talk
Bring it in
bring it in

Let's walk
Bring it in
bring it in
Free hugs
Bring it in
bring it in

I grow rows and
rows of roses
Flor de mayo
By the mile

I make perfect
practiced poses
So much hides behind my smile
What could I do
if I just grew
what I was feeling in the moment

What could I do if I just knew it didn't need to be perfect It just needed to be
And they let me be
A hurricane of jacarandas
Strangling figs Hanging vines
Palma de cera fills the air as I climb And I push through

What else can I do
Can I deliver us a river of sundew
Careful it's carnivorous
a little just won't do
I wanna feel the shiver of something new
I'm so sick of pretty
I want something true
don't you

You just seem like your life's been a dream
Since the moment you opened your eyes
How far do these roots go down
All I know are the blossoms you grow
But it's awesome to see

how you rise
How far can I rise
Through the roof
to the skies
Let's go

A hurricane of jacarandas
Strangling figs Hanging vines
Palma de cera fills the air as I climb And I push through

What else
what else
What can you do when you are deeply madly truly in the moment
Seize the moment keep goin'

What can you do when you know who you wanna be isn't perfect
But I'll still be okay
Hey
everybody
clear the way

I'm coming through with tabebuia
She's coming through
with that booyah
Making waves
Making waves
Changing minds

You've changed mine
The way is clearer 'cause you're here
and well
I owe this all to you
What else can I do

Show 'em what you can do
What else can I do
There's nothing you can't do
What else can I do
==========
Drawers
Floors
Doors
Let's go

This is our home
We've got every generation
So full of music A rhythm of its own design

This is my family
A perfect constellation
So many stars and everybody gets to shine

But let's be clear
Abuela runs this show
She led us here so many years ago
Whoa And every year our family blessings grow
Whoa There's just a lot you've simply got to know

Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal
We're on our way
Wherе all the people arе fantastical and magical
I’m part of the Family Madrigal

My tía Pepa
Her mood affects the weather
When she's unhappy
Well the temperature gets weird
My tío Bruno
We don’t talk about Bruno

They say he saw the future
one day he disappeared
And that's my mom Julieta
here's her deal
The truth is
she can heal you with a meal

Her recipes are remedies
for real
If you're impressed imagine how I feel
Mom

Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal
I know it sounds a bit fantastical and magical
But I'm part of the Family Madrigal

Two guys fell in love with Family Madrigal
And now they're part of the Family Madrigal
Tío Félix married Pepa
And my dad married Julieta

That's how Abuela became an Abuela Madrigal
Let's go
let's go

We swear to always
Help those around us
And earn the miracle
That somehow found us

The town keeps growing
The world keeps turning
But work and dedication will keep the miracle burning
And each new generation must keep the miracle burning

Wait who's a sister and who's a cousin
There's so many people
How do you keep them all straight

Okay
okay
okay
okay

So many kids in our house
So let's turn the sound up
You know why
I think it's time for
a grandkid round up
Grandkid round up

Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop
Camilo shape shifts
Antonio gets his gift today
My older sisters
Isabela and Luisa
One strong one graceful Perfect in every way

Isabela
Grows a flower
the town goes wild
Isabela
She's a perfect golden child

Luisa Luisa
Luisa Luisa
And Luisa's super strong
The beauty and the brawn do no wrong

That's life in the Family Madrigal
Whoa Now you know the Family Madrigal
Whoa Where all the people are fantastical and magical
Whoa That's who we are in the Family Madrigal Adios

Well I
gotta go
the life of the Madrigal
But now you all know the Family Madrigal

I never meant this to
get autobiographical
So just to review the Family Madrigal Let's go

But what about Mirabel
It starts with Abuela
And then Tía Pepa
she handles the weather

But what about Mirabel
My mom Julieta
can make you feel better with just one arepa

My primo Camilo won't stop until he makes you smile today
My cousin Dolores can hear this whole chorus a mile away
Look it's Mister Mariano
You can marry my sister if you wanna but

Between you and me
she's kind of a prima donna
Yo I've said too much
and thank you but I really gotta go
My family's amazing
And I'm in my family so
Well
==========
Look at this home
We need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but
we'll get by just fine
Look at this family
a glowing constellation

So full of stars
and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift

And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not
some magic that you've got

The miracle is you
not some gift
just you
The miracle is you
All of you
all of you

Okay so we gonna talk about Bruno
That's Bruno
there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start

I'm sorry 'bout your wedding
didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy
I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know
that your bro loves you so

Let it in
let it out
let it rain
let it snow let it go
That's what I'm always saying bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
Hey we're just happy that you're here okay

Come into the light
the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo I knew he never left
I heard him every day

What's that sound
I think it's everyone in town

Lay down your load
Lay down your load
We are only down the road
We are only down the road
We have no gifts
but we are many
And we'll do anything for you

It's a dream when we work as a team
You're so strong
but sometimes I cry
So do I

I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah I need sunlight and fertilizer
C'mon let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky

let's go
The stars don't shine
they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn

Hey Mariano
why so blue
I just have so much love inside
Y'know I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores

You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry
every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment so would you wake up and notice me

Dolores
I see you
And I hear you

All of you
all of you
Let's get married
All of you
all of 

Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we
Just one more thing
before the celebration

We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now see yourself in turn

You're the real gift
let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see
I see me
All of me
==========
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling
like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal don't feel
don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go
let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
let it go
Turn away and slam the door

I don't care
what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right no wrong no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go
let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go
let it go
You'll never see me cry

Here I stand
and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back
the past is in the past

Let it go
let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go
let it go
That perfect girl is gone

Here I stand
in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
==========
Bees they'll buzz
kids will blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer

A drink in my hand
my snow up against the burning sand
Probably getting gorgeously tanned
in summer

I'll finally see a summer breeze blow away a winter storm
And find out what happens to solid
water when it gets warm

And I can't
wait to see
what my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer

The hot and the cold are
both so intense
Put 'em together
it just makes sense
Winter's a good time to
stay in and cuddle
But put me in summer and I'll be a happy snowman

When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream
Of relaxing in the summer sun just lettin' off steam
Oh the sky will be blue
and you guys will be there too

When I finally do
what frozen things do
in summer
In summer
==========
Do you want to build a snowman
Come on let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why

Do you want to buid a snowman
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Do you want to build a snowman
Or ride our bike around the hall
I think some company is overdue

I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by

Please I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say have courage
And I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Please let me in

We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do
Do you want to build a snowman
==========
The window is open so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight tousand salad plates

For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls
Finally they're opening up the gates

There'll be actual real live people
It'll be totally strange
But wow am I so ready for this change

'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music
there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night

Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

Tonight imagine me gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace

I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far

For the first time in forever
There'll be magic there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone

And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal
Don't feel
Put on a show
Make one wrong move
And everyone will know
But it's only for today

It's only for today
It's agony to wait
It's agony to wait
Tell the guards to open up the gate
The gate

For the first time in forever
Don't let them in
Don't let them see
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of
Be the good girl you always have to be
A chance to change my lonely world

Conceal
A chance to find true love
Conceal don't feel
Don't let them know

I know it all ends tomorrow
So it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way
==========
Please don't slam the door
You don't have to keep your distance anymore
'Cause for the first time in forever
I finally understand

For the first time in forever
We can fix this hand in hand

We can head down this mountain together
You don't have to live in fear
'Cause for the first time in forever
I will be right here

Please go back home
Your life awaits
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates

You mean well
But leave me be
Yes I'm alone but I'm alone and free
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me
==========
Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining

Cut through the heart
cold and clear
Strike for love and strike for fear
See the beauty sharp and sheer
Split the ice apart
And break the frozen heart

Beautiful
powerful
dangerous
cold

Ice has a magic can't be controlled
Stronger than one
stronger than ten
Stronger than a hundred men

Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining

Cut through the heart
cold and clear
Strike for love and strike for fear
There's beauty and there's danger here
Split the ice apart
Beware the frozen heart
==========
Is it the clumpy way he walks
Or the grumpy way he talks
Or the pear-shaped square-shaped weirdness of his feet
And though we know he washes well
he always ends up sorta smelly
But you'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet

So he's a bit of a fixer upper
So he's got a few flaws
His peculiar brain dear
his thing for the reindeer
That's outside a few of nature's laws

So he's a bit of a fixer upper
but this we're certain of
You can fix this fixer upper
with a little bit of love

Is it the way that he runs scared
Or that he's socially impaired
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods
Are you holding back your fondness
Due to his unmanly blondness
Or the way he covers up
that he's the honest goods

He's just a bit of a fixer upper
He's got a couple of bugs
His isolation
is confirmation
Of his desperation
for healing hugs

So he's a bit of a fixer upper
But we know what to do
The way to fix this fixer upper
Is to fix him up with you

So she's a bit of a fixer upper
That's a minor thing
This quote engagement
is a flex arrangement
And by the way I don't see no ring

So she's a bit of a fixer upper
Her brain's a bit betwixt
Get the fiance out of the way
And the whole thing will be fixed

We aren't saying you can change him
'Cause people don't really change
We're only saying that love's a force that's
powerful and strange

People make bad choices if they're
mad or scared or stressed
But throw a little love their way
and you'll bring out their best
True love brings out the best

Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper
That's what it's all about
Father
sister
brother
We need each other
To raise us up and round us out

Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper
But when push comes to shove
The only fixer upper fixer That can fix a fixer upper is

Reindeers are better than people
Sven don't you think that's true
Yeah people will beat you and curse you and cheat you
Every one of em's bad
except you

But people smell better than reindeers
Sven don't you think I'm right
That's once again true
for all except you

You got me
Let's call it a night
Good night
Don't let the frostbite bite
==========
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep my darling
safe and sound

For in this river all is found
In her waters
deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you

Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned
Yes she will sing to those who hear
And in her song all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear
Can you face
what the river knows

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come my darling
homeward bound
When all is lost, then all is found
==========
Yes the wind blows a little colder
And we're all getting older
And the clouds are moving on with
every autumn breeze
Peter Pumpkin just became
fertilizer
And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser

That's why I rely on certain certainties
Yes some things never change
Like the feel of your hand in mine
Some things stay the same
Like how we get along just fine

Like an old stone wall that'll never fall
Some things are always true
Some things never change
Like how I'm holding
on tight to you

The leaves are already falling
Sven it feels like the future is calling
Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee
Yep but I'm really bad at planning these things out
Like candlelight and pulling of rings out
Maybe you should
leave all the romantic stuff to me

some things never change
Like the love that I feel for her
Some things stay the same
Like how reindeers are easier

But if I commit
and I go for it
I'll know what to say and do
Some things never change
Sven the pressure is all on you

The winds are restless
Could that be why I'm hearing this call
Is something coming
I'm not sure
I want things to change at all

These days are precious
can't let them slip away
I can't freeze this moment
but I can still go out and seize this day

The wind blows a little bit colder
And you all look a little bit older
It's time to count our blessings beneath an autumn sky

We'll always live in the kingdom of plenty
that stands for the good of the many
And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly

Our flag will always fly
Some things never change
Turn around and the time has flown
Some things stay the same
Though the future remains unknown
May our good come back
May our past be past
Time's moving fast it's true
Some things never change

And I'm holding on tight to you
I'm holding on tight to you
==========
I can hear you
but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons
I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers
which I wish would go away

You're not a voice
You're just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you which I don't
I'm spoken for I fear
Everyone I've ever loved
is here within these walls

I'm sorry
secret siren
but I'm blocking out your calls
I've had my adventure
I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

What do you want
'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake

Or are you someone out there
who's a little bit like me
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be
Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go…

Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

Are you out there
Do you know me
Can you feel me
Can you show me

Where are you going Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you, Into the unknown
==========
This will all make sense
when I am older
Someday I will see that this makes sense
One day when I'm old and wise
I'll think back and realize

That these were all completely
normal events
I'll have all the answers when I'm older
Like why we're in this dark
enchanted wood

I know in a couple years these will seem
like childish fears
And so I know this isn't bad it's good

Excuse me
Growing up means adapting Puzzling out your world
and your place
When I'm more mature
I'll feel comfortably secure

Being watched by something with a creepy creepy face
See that will all make
sense when I am older
So there's no need to be terrified or tense

I'll just dream about a time
When I'm in my aged prime
'Cause when you're older
Absolutely everything makes sense
This is fine
==========
Reindeers are better than people
Sven why is love so hard
You feel what
you feel
And those feelings are real
Come on Kristoff
let down your guard
==========
Again you're gone
off on a different path than mine
I'm left behind
wondering if I should follow
You had to go
and of course it's always fine
I probably could catch up
with you tomorrow

But is this what it feels like to be
growing apart
When did I become the one who's always chasing your heart
Now I turn around and find
I am lost in the woods

North is south
right is left
when you're gone
I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I don't know what path you are on
I'm lost in the woods

Up till now
the next step was a question of how
I never thought it
was a question of whether

Who am I
if I'm not your guy
Where am I
if we're not together
Forever

Now I know you're my true north
'Cause I am lost in the woods
Up is down
day is night
when you're not there

you're my only landmark
So I'm lost in the woods
Wondering if you still care
But I'll wait for a sign
For a sign
That I'm your path
'Cause you are mine
You are mine

Until then
I'm lost in the woods
I'm lost in the woods
I'm lost in the woods
==========
Every inch of me is trembling
And not from the cold
Something is familiar
Like a dream
I can reach but not quite hold

I can sense you there
Like a friend I've always known
I'm arriving
And it feels like I am home
I have always been a fortress
Cold secrets deep inside
You have secrets too but you don't have to hide

Show yourself
I'm dying to meet you
Show yourself
It's your turn

Are you the
one I've been looking for all of my life
Show yourself
I'm ready to learn

I've never felt so certain
All my life I've been torn
But I'm here for a reason
Could it be the reason I was born

I've always been so different
Normal rules did not apply
Is this the day
Are you the way
I finally find out why

Show yourself
I'm no longer trembling
Here I am
I've come so far
You are the answer I've waited for all of my life
Oh show yourself
Let me see who you are

Come to me now
open your door
Don't make me wait
one moment more

Come to me now
open your door
Don't make me wait
one moment more

Where
the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Come my darling homeward bound
I am found

Show yourself
Step into your power
Throw yourself
into something new
You are the one you've been waiting for all of your life
==========
I've seen dark before
but not like this
This is cold
this is empty
this is numb

The life
I knew is over
the lights are out
Hello darkness
I'm ready to succumb

I follow you around
I always have
But you've gone
to a place I cannot find

This grief has a gravity
it pulls me down
But a tiny voice whispers in my mind

You are lost
hope is gone
But you must go on
And do the next right thing
Can there be a day
beyond this night

I don't know anymore
what is true
I can't find my direction
I'm all alone

The only star that guided me was you
How to rise from the floor
When it's not you I'm rising for

Just do the
next right thing
Take a step
step again
It is all that I can to do
The next right thing

I won't look too far ahead
It's too much for me to take
But break it down to this next breath

this next step
This next choice
is one that I can make
So I'll walk
through this night

Stumbling blindly toward the light
And do the next right thing
And with the dawn what comes then
When it's clear
that everything will never be the same again
Then I'll make the choice to hear that voice And do the next right thing
==========
Well, this car is automatic
It's systematic
It's hydromatic

It's greased lightnin
We'll get some overhead lifters and four barrel quads, oh yeah
Keep talking, woah, keep talking
A fuel injection cut off and chrome plated rods, oh yeah 
I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money

With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door
You know that it ain't shit, we'll be gettin' lots of tit, greased lightnin'

Go, greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin'
Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin'
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'

We'll get some purple pitched tail lights and thirty inch fins, oh yeah
A palomino dashboard and duel-muffler twins, oh yeah With new boosters, plates and shocks, I can get off my rocks
You know that I ain't braggin', she's a real pussy wagon, greased lightnin'

Go, greased lightnin', you're burning up the quarter mile
Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin'
Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin'
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder
of my big home

The bees are buzzin'
in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants

The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Next time beware

Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you
And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
==========
That morning sun peeks over the mountains
And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear
Hear what
Hear the jungle rhythm

Those birds are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks
The busy bee hums as he flies
Loud and clear
To the jungle rhythm

Now you can hightail it out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder

It's moving me
Sounds a lot like being free
When you feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm

Can't do without rhythm
And when it fills the air
Animals everywhere
join in the dance

You'll dance along with 'em
Feel it steal your soul
We'll stomp our paws
Flap our wings
Maybe do one, two crazy things

Check out those chat-chat-chattering monkeys
Swinging through the banyan trees
Two by two
To the jungle rhythm

Sounds like a wolf pack way in the distance
Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo
To the jungle rhythm

Now you can hightail it out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder

It's moving me
Sounds a lot like being free
When you feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
==========
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the
top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me

I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

obeedoo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be humen too

Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with you What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Give me the secret, mancub
Clue me what to do Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you

I wanna be like you
I wanna talk like you
Walk like you, too
You'll see it's true

Someone like me
Can learn to be
Like someone like me
Can learn to be
Like someone like you, Can learn to be
==========
One day more
Another day, another destiny
This never-ending road to Calvary
These men who seem to know my crime
Will surely come a second time

One day more
I did not live until today
How can I live when we are parted

One day more
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you, my world has started

One more day all on my own
Will we ever meet again
One more day with him not caring
I was born to be with you
What a life I might have known
And I swear I will be true
But he never saw me there

One more day before the storm
Do I follow where she goes
At the barricades of Freedom
Shall I join my brothers there
When our ranks begin to form
Do I stay or do I dare
Will you take your place with me

The time is now
The day is here
One day more

One day more till revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood

One day more
Watch them run amuck
Catch'm as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all

Here a little dip
There a little touch
Most of them are goners so they won't miss much

One day to a new beginning
Raise the flag of freedom high
Every man will be a king
Every man will be a king
Do you hear the people sing
There's a new world to be won

My place is here
I fight with you
One day more
We will join these people's heroes
I did not live until today

One day more
Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all

We'll be ready for these schoolboys
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day
Tomorrow we'll discover

One more dawn
One more day
One day more
==========
How strange
This feeling that my life's begun at last
This change Can people fall in love so fast

What's the matter with you, Cosette
Have you been too much on your own
So many things unclear
So many things unknown

In my life
Ever so many questions
and answers
That somehow seems wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of the faraway song

And it sings Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach
Just a whisper away
waiting for me

Does he know I'm alive
Do I know if he's real
Does he see what I see
Does he feel what I feel

In my life
I'm no longer alone Now the love in my life is so near
Find me now
Find me here

Dear Cosette You're such  a lonely child
How pensive, how sad you seem to me
Believe me
Were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be
I can see
With only me for company

There's so little I know that I'm longing to know
Of the man that you were in a time long ago

There's so little you say of the life you have known
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone
So dark, so dark and deep
The secrets that you keep

In my life
Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good
But Papa
Dear Papa
In your eyes I am still like the child
Who's lost in a wood

No more words
No more words it's a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard,
better unsaid

In my life
I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years, Years ago

In my life
She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun
And my life
Seems to stop as if something is over And something has scarcely begun

Eponine You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you I am at one with the gods
And Heaven is near
And I soar through a world that is new that is free

Every word that he says is a dagger in me
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere, where he is
If he asked

In my life
In my life
==========
There was a time
when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind

And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed, The dream I dreamed
==========
Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon,
too soon to say goodbye

Yes, Cosette,
forbid me now to die
I'll obey I will try

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven Look down on him in mercy
Forgive me all my trespasses And take me to your glory

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end And the sun will rise

They will live again in freedom In the garden of the Lord
We will walk behind the ploughshare
We will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward

Will you join in our crusade
Who will be strong and stand with me
Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see

Do you hear the people sing
Say, do you hear the distant drums
It is the future that we bring When tomorrow comes

Will you join in our crusade
Who will be strong and stand with me
Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see

Do you hear the people sing
Say, do you hear the distant drums
It is the future that we bring When tomorrow comes
==========
Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks
Rooking their guests and cooking the books

Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house,
doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur

Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price

Master of the house,
keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine
making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight

Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus Won't I bleed 'em in the end

Master of the house,
quick to catch yer eye
Never was a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor,
butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate

Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone
But lock up your valises
Jesus, Won't I skin you to the bone

Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse,
liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that

Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges Plus some little extras on the side

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Hand it over
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut

When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks I knows
How it all increases, all them bits and pieces
Jesus, It's amazing how it grows

Master of the house
Isn't worth my spit
Comforter, philosopher and lifelong shit
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there

What a cruel trick of nature
landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house
==========
Drink with me to days gone by
To the life that usedto be
At the shrine of friendship,
never say die
Let the wine of friendship never run dry
Here's to you and here's to me

Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea
Life without Cosette Means nothing at all
Would you weep, Cosette, if I were to fall
Would you weep, Cosette, for me
==========
I smell women
Smell 'em in the air
Think I'll drop my anchor
In that harbor over there

Lovely ladies
Smell 'em through the smoke
Seven days at sea Can make you hungry for a poke

Even stokers need a little stoke
Lovely ladies
Waiting for a bite
Waiting for the customers Who only come at night

Lovely ladies
Ready for the call
Standing up or lying down Or any way at all
Bargain prices up against the wall

Come here, my dear Let's see this trinket you wear
This bagatelle
Madame, I'll sell it to you
I'll give you four
That wouldn't pay for the chain

I'll give you five
You're far to eager to sell
It's up to you
It's all I have
That's not my fault
No more than five
My dear, we all must stay alive

Lovely ladies
Waiting in the dark
Ready for a thick one
Or a quick one in the park

Long time short time
Any time, my dear
Cost a little extra if you
want to take all year
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier

What pretty hair
What pretty locks you got there
What luck you got
It's worth a centime, my dear

Don't touch me
Leave me alone
Let's make a price
I'll give you all of ten francs,
Just think of that
It pays a debt
Just think of that

What can I do
It pays a debt
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette
Lovely lady
Fastest on the street
Wasn't there three minutes She was back up on her feet

Lovely lady
What yer waiting for
Doesn't take a lot of savvy Just to be a whore

Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there
A bit of skirt
She's the one sold her hair
She's got a kid
Sends her all that she can

I might have known
There is always some man
Lovely lady, come along and join us
Lovely lady

Come on dearie, why all the fuss
You're no grander than the rest of us
Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap
Join your sisters

Make money in your sleep
That's right dearie, let him have the lot
That's right dearie, show him what you've got
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come
Harbor rats and alley cats and every kind of scum

Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land
See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand
All it takes is money in your hand

Lovely ladies
Going for a song
Got a lot of callers But they never stay for long

Come on, Captain,
you can wear your shoes
Don't it make a change To have a girl who can't refuse

Easy money
Lying on a bed
Just as well they never see The hate that's in your head
Don't they know they're making love To one already dead
==========
There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
Mine is the way of the Law
Those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward

And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flames The sword

Stars In your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same

And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be,
for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars
I will never rest
Till then
This I swear
This I swear by the stars
==========
A ghost you say, a ghost maybe
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, then she was gone

I am agog
I am aghast
Is Marius
in love at last

I've never heard him 'ooh' and 'aah'
You talk of battles to be won
And here he comes like Don Juan
It's better than an opera

It is time for us all To decide who we are
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now

Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay
Is this simply a game
For a rich young boy to play
The colours of the world
Are changing day by day

Red
the blood of angry men
Black
the dark of ages past
Red
a world about to dawn
Black
the night that ends at last

Had you seen her today
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight
Had you been there today
You might also have known

How your world may be changed
In just one burst of light
And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right

Red
I feel my soul on fire
Black
My world if she's not there
Red
It's the colour of desire
Black
It's the colour of despair

Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call
Who cares about your lonely soul
We strive towards a larger goal
Our little lives don't count at all

Red
the blood of angry men
Black
the dark of ages past
Red
a world about to dawn
Black
the night that ends at last
==========
There is a castle on a cloud
I like to go there in my sleep
Aren't any floors for me to sweep
Not in my castle on a cloud

There is a lady all in white
Holds me and sings a lullaby
She's nice to see and she's soft to touch
She says, "Cosette, I love you very much

I know a place where no one's lost
I know a place where no one cries
Crying at all is not allowed
Not in my castle on a cloud
==========
Who is this man
What sort of
devil is he
To have me caught in a trap
And choose to let me go free
It was his hour at last
To put a seal on my fate

Wipe out the past
And wash me clean off the slate
All it would take
Was a flick of his knife
Vengeance was his
And he gave me back my life

Damned if I'll live in the debt of a thief
Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase
I am the Law and the Law is not mocked
I'll spit his pity right back in his face
There is nothing on earth that we share
It is either Valjean or Javert

And must I now begin to doubt
Who never doubted all these years
My heart is stone and still it trembles
The world I have known is lost in shadow

Is he from heaven or from hell
And does he know
That granting me my life today
This man has killed me even so

I am reaching, but I fall
And the stars are black and cold
As I stare into the void
Of a world that cannot hold

I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
There is nowhere I can turn
There is no way to go on
==========
Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men
It is the music of the people Who will not be slaves again

When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes

Will you join in our crusade Who will be strong and stand with me
Beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see
Then join in the fight That will give you the right to be free

Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men
It is the music of the people Who will not be slaves again

When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes

Will you give all you can give So that our banner may advance
Some will fall and some will live Will you stand up and take your chance
The blood of the martyrs Will water the meadows of France

Do you hear the people sing
Singing the song of angry men
It is the music of the people Who will not be slaves again

When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes
==========
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now

You're here, that's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow

But you will live,  dear God above,
If I could heal your wounds with words of love
Just hold me now, and let it be
Shelter me, comfort me

You would live a hundred years
If I could show you how
I won't desert you now

The rain can't hurt me now
This rain
will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I'll sleep in your embrace at last

The rain that brings you here
Is Heaven-blessed
The skies begin to clear
And I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far

So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now

That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close

Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine,
You won't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt you now
I'm here

I will stay with you
Till you are sleeping
And rain
Will make the flowers
grow
==========
Cosette, it's turned so cold
Cosette, it's past your bedtime
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night

Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading
Don't you see the evening star appearing
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder

Hurry near, another day is dying
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying
There's a darkness which comes without a warning
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning

Oh, Fantine, our time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life
Look, M'sieur, where all the children play
Be at peace, be at peace evermore

My Cosette
Shall live in my protection
Take her now
Your child will want for nothing
Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven
And none shall ever harm Cosette As long as I am living

Take my hand
The night grows ever colder
Then I will keep you warm
Take my child
I give her to your keeping
Take shelter from the storm

For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her, And I'll see her when I wake
==========
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone

Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about `tomorrow'
And tomorrow never came

From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
I can hear them now The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn

Oh my friends, my friends forgive me That I live and you are gone
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on

Phantom faces at the window
Phantom shadows on the floor
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no more

Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me
What your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friend will sing no more
==========
At the end of the day
you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day standing about, what is it for
One day less to be living

At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying

At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and There's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day

At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread
There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job
And in a bed
And we're counting our blessings

Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands

And the boss, he never knows
That the foreman is always in heat
If Fantine doesn't look out Watch how she goes
She'll be out on the street

At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
Keep on grafting till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs off the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day

And what have we here, little innocent sister
Come on Fantine,
let's have all the news
"Dear Fantine you must send us more money
Your child needs a doctor There's no time to lose

Give that letter to me
It is none of your business
With a husband at home And a bit on the side
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear
She has nothing to hide

What is this fighting all about
Will someone tear these two apart
This is a factory, not a circus
Now, come on ladies, settle down
I run a business of repute
I am the Mayor of this town

I look to you to sort this out
And be as patient
as you can-
Now someone say
how this began

At the end of the day
She's the one who began it
There's a kid that she's hiding
In some little town

There's a man she has to pay
You can guess how she picks up the extra
You can bet she's earning her keep
Sleeping around
And the boss wouldn't like it

Yes it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter
And her father abandoned us Leaving us flat
Now she lives with an innkeeper man And his wife
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that

At the end of the day
She'll be nothing but trouble
And there's trouble for all When there's trouble for one

While we're earning our daily bread
She's the one with her hands in the butter
You must send the slut away
Or we're all gonna end in the gutter
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day

I might have known the bitch could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret

Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean
You'd be the cause I had no doubt
Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night

He thought that man was me
Without a second glance
That stranger he has found
This man could be my chance

Why should I save his hide
Why should I right this wrong
When I have come so far
And struggled for so long

If I speak, I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned

I am the master of hundreds of workers They all look to me
How can I abandon them
How would they live
If I am not free

If I speak, they are condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned

Who am I
Can I condemn this man to slavery
Pretend I do not feel his agony
This innocent who wears my face
Who goes to judgement in my place

Who am I
Can I conceal myself for evermore
Pretend I'm not the man I was before
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi
Must I lie

How can I ever face my fellow men
How can I ever face myself again
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago
He gave me hope when hope was gone
He gave me strength to journey on

Who am I
Who am I
I'm Jean Valjean

And so Javert, you see it's true
This man bears no more guilt than you
Who am I
Two four six o one
==========
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded

When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board

The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point htat I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me

So prepare for the coup of the centrury
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial Is simply why I'll
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am

Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared
Yes, our teeth
and ambitions are bared
Be prepared

He could clear the savannah after every meal

And it hurt
that my friends never stood downwind

Thought of changin´ my name
What´s in a name

I'm gonna be a mighty king,
so enemies beware
Well I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair

I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

This far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
You've rather a long way to go, young master,
if you think

No one saying do this
Now when I said that --
No one saying be there
What I meant was --

No one saying stop that
What you don't realize -- No one saying see here
Now see here

Free to run around all day
That's definitely out
Free to do it all my way

I think it's time
that you and I arranged a heart-to-heart
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start

If this is where the monarchy is headed Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about

This child is getting wildly
out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm
Standing in the spotlight
Not yet

Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said,
"No thanks

We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back for lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

What are you doing, son
Pouncing
Stay low to the ground
Yeah, okay, stay low to the ground, right
Shh, not a sound
Take it slow
One more step

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small
on the endless round

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love

Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the Circle
The Circle of Life

I can see what's happening
And they don't have a clue
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

The sweet caress of twilight There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past
Impossible
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king
I know he is
The king I see inside

Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight
You needn't look too far
Stealing through
the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls
in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days
with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed

The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake

Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for

Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me

Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl

But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate

Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook

We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea
Under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally

Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea

The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul

The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow

Under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me

What do they got
A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
know how to jam here
Under the sea

Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea

Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here, Under the sea

Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything

Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold
Looking around here you'd think Sure, she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmo's a-plenty
I've got woozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs
I've got twenty

But who cares
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
What do you call 'em
oh, feet

Flipping your fins you don't get to far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
strolling along down the
What's that word again
street

Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand

Bet'cha on land
They understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word
burn
When's it my turn
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore the shore up above

Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world

Percussion Strings
Winds
Words

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don’t got a lot to say But there’s something about her
And you don’t know why
But you’re dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl

Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
It’s possible she wants you, too There is one way to ask her
It don’t take a word Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl

Sing with me now
My, oh, my
Look at the boy too shy
He ain’t gonna kiss the girl
Ain’t that sad
Ain’t it shame, too bad
You gonna miss the girl

Now’s your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don’t say a word
And she won’t say a word
Until you kiss the girl

Don’t be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Don’t stop now
Don’t try to hide it how
You wanna kiss the girl

Float along
Listen to the song
The song say kiss the girl
Music play
Do what the music say
You wanna kiss the girl

What would I give to live where you are
What would I pay to stay here beside you
What would I do to see you, smiling at me

Where would we walk
Where would we run
If we could stay all day in the sun
Just you and me
And I could be
Part of your world

I don't know when
I don't know how
But I know something's starting right now
Watch and you'll see
Someday I'll be
Part of your world

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch

And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And dear lady, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain,
in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them
Yes, indeed

Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please
And I help them
Yes I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to
rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

The men up there don't
like a lot of blabber
They think
a girl who gossips is a bore
Yet on land it's much prefered
For ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle babble for

Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's a man

Come on you
poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman
and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice

You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul
==========
I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why

I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try

Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back
To the place I know
where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows
How far it goes

If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design

I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied
if I play along
But the voice inside
sings a different song
What is wrong with me

See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows
How deep it goes

And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

And the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows
How far it goes

If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go
==========
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud

Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are

The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you

And when that voice starts to whisper
"Moana, you've come so far"
Moana listen, do you know who you are

I am a girl who loves my island
And the girl who loves the sea, it calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me

I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me

And the call isn't out there at all
It's inside me
It's like the tide Always falling and rising

I will carry you here in my heart
You'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana
==========
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby

Did your granny say, "Listen to your heart"
"Be who you are on the inside"
I need three words to tear her argument apart
Your granny lied

I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck
and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec,
don't you know

Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come To the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm, fish dinners
I just love free food
And you look like seafood

Little Maui's having trouble with his look
You little semi-demi-mini-god
What a terrible performance
Get the hook
You don't swing it like you used to man
Yet I have to give you credit for my start

And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide, I can't 
I'm too shiny

Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff
my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man

You could try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod
To beat a decapod
Look it up

You will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your aching heart Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans Who made you feel wanted
You try to be tough
But your armour's just not
hard enough

Now it's time to kick your hiney
Ever seen someone so Shiny
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny

Now I'll eat
you so prepare your final plea
Just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny 
==========
I see what's happening yeah
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
Well it's nice to see that humans never change

Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes it's really me, It's Maui Breathe it in
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

What can I say except
"You're welcome"
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy

Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling ye high
This guy
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below
You're looking at him, yo

also I lasso'd the sun, you're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze You're welcome, to fill your sails and shake your trees

So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay,
you're welcome
I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it

Kid, honestly I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around

I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson
What is the takeaway Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway

And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tappin'

Well anyway, let me say
you're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go

Hey, it's your day to say
you're welcome
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui can do anything but float
You're welcome, you're welcome
==========
I have crossed the horizon to find you
I know your name
They have stolen the heart from inside you
But this does not define you
This is not who you are
You know who you are
==========
Moana, make way, make way
Moana it's time you knew
The village of Motonui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song
Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need

This tradition is our mission
And Moana there's so much to do
Don't trip on the taro root that's all you need
We share everything we make
We joke and we weave our baskets
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see
Don't walk away
Moana stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief and there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is where you are

Consider the coconut
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut, that's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers
The water's sweet inside
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

Consider the coconuts
The trunks and the leaves
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

That's right we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
You must find happiness right where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous,
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like well there you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana that voice inside is who you are

The village believes in us The village believes
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay My home my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are
I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Where we are

Cause every path leads you back to
Where you are
You can find happiness right
Where you are
Where you are
==========
There's a line where the sky
meets the sea and it calls me
But no one knows,
how far it goes
All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own,
to worlds unknown

Every turn I take,
every trail I track
Is a choice I make,
now I can't turn back
From the great unknown
where I go alone
Where I long to be

See her lie
with the night
in the sea,
she calls me
And yes I know
that I can go

There's a moon
in the sky
and the wind is behind me Soon I'll know
how far I'll go
==========
We read the wind and the sky
when the sun is high
We sail the length of the seas
on the ocean breeze

At night, we name every star
We know where we are
We know who we are, who we are

We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain
Te fenua, te mālie
Nā heko hakilia
We know the way
==========
Seven A.M. the usual morning lineup
Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean
Polish and wax do laundry and mop and shine up
Sweep again and by then it's like seven fifteen

And so I read a book
Or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit
And cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin

Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
Paper mache a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy
candle making
Then I'll stretch
maybe sketch
take a climb Sew a dress

And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare
I'll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere
And then I'll brush and brush
And brush and brush my hair

Stuck in the same place I've always been
And I'll keep wondering and wondering And wondering
When will my life begin

Tomorrow night
The lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year
What is it like
Out there where they glow
Now that I'm older
Mother might just
Let me go
==========
I'm malicious mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
But despite my evil look
And my temper and my hook

I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart
Tickling the ivories 'til they gleam
Yep I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley

'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream
He's got a dream
He's got a dream

See I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers
Like everybody else I've got a dream

I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes
And let's not even mention my complexion
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter, and my nose

I really want to make a love connection
Can't you see me with a special little lady
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter --

'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream
I've got a dream
He's got a dream
I've got a dream
He's got a dream

And I know one day romance will reign supreme
Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it dreaming --
Like everybody else I've got a dream

Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime

Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns

I have dreams like you - no, really
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

I've got a dream
She's got a dream
I've got a dream
She's got a dream

Like all you lovely folks I've got a dream
She's got a dream
He's got a dream
They've got a dream
We've got a dream

So our diff 'rences ain't
really that extreme
We're one big team
Call us brutal Sick Sadistic
And grotesquely optimistic

Cause way down deep inside We've got a dream
I've got a dream
I've got a dream
I've got a dream
I've got a dream
I've got a dream
I've got a dream
==========
All those days
Watching from the windows
All those years
Outside looking in
All that time
Never even knowing Just how blind I've been

Now I'm here
Blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here
Suddenly I see
Standing here
It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be

And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted

All at once
Everything looks different
Now that I see you

All those days
Chasing down a daydream
All those years
Living in a blur

All that time
Never truly seeing
Things the way they were
Now she's here
Shining in the starlight

Now she's here
Suddenly I know
If she's here
It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go

And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new

And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once
Everything is different
Now that I see you
Now that I see you

She's a girl with the best intentions
He's a man of his own invention
She looked out of the window He walked out the door
But she followed him
And he said, "What'cha lookin' for

She said I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see

Something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see

He's been livin' in a pure illusion
She's gonna come
to her own conclusion
Right when you think you know what to say
Someone comes along and shows you a brand new way

She said, "I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see

Something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything - 'cause It's so easy to make believe,
it seems you're livin' in a dream Don't you see that what you need
is standing in front of you I want something that I want

Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see
Something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see

You want to go outside
Why, Rapunzel
Look at you, as fragile as a flower
Still a little
sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower

That's right, to keep you safe and sound, dear
Guess I always knew this day was coming
Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet
Trust me, pet

Mother knows best
Mother knows best
Listen to your mother
It's a scary world out there
Mother knows best

One way or another Something will go wrong, I swear
Ruffians, thugs
Poison ivy, quicksand
Cannibals and snakes
The plague

Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth, and
Stop, no more, you'll
just upset me
Mother's right here

Mother will protect you
Darling, here's what I suggest
Skip the drama
Stay with mama
Mother knows best

Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy
On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, underdressed Immature, clumsy
Please, they'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naive
Positively grubby
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm vague

Plus, I believe
Gettin' kinda chubby
I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you Mother understands
Mother's here to help you
All I have is one request
==========
Flower, gleam and glow
Let your power shine
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine

Heal what has been hurt
Change the Fates' design
Save what has been lost
Bring back what once was mine
What once was mine
==========
This is why you never should have left
Dear, this whole romance
that you've invented
Just proves you're too naive to be here
Why would he like you
Come on now - really

Look at you
- you think that he's impressed
Don't be a dummy
Come with mummy
Mother -

Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now
Such a clever grown-up miss
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now
Go ahead, then give him this

This is why he's here
Don't let him deceive you
Give it to him, watch, you'll see

Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you
I won't say I told you so - no Rapunzel knows best
So if he's such a dreamboat
Go and put him to the test

If he's lying
Don't come crying
Mother knows best
