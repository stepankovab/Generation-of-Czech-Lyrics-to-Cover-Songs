ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF A NATURAL DISASTER

I found an infant alligator floating
in Perkins’ Bayou yesterday, between
Louisiana iris and the green
of blighted summer reeds, its stomach bloating
with harsh, bright, glaring sunlight, without fault
or scale, as crocodiles would have; its head
chin up and oblong, grimacing, as dead
as mausoleum marble, white as salt.
Delight in a discovery so exotic
could not be lost on me, however grim.
Mosquito larvae harbored in a scrim
of water on the western bank, hypnotic
and circling with the rise-and-falling rasp
of locusts at the cypress. In my grasp
a camera – in case some killer storm
destroys this haunt tomorrow, everything
familiar, safe, replaced by suffering —
chaos projecting fatally through form.
