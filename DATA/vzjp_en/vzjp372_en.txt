I REMEMBER

I remember when I was born –
I do remember!
Through eternity I slept,
By its quiet water swept,
In its silence safely kept.
All unknowing, night or day,
All unthinking, there I lay.
… Suddenly, by life compelled,
I was free, no longer held;
Free to hear and feel and cry;
Free to live – or free to die;
Free to be that which I am.
I remember when I was born –
I do remember!
