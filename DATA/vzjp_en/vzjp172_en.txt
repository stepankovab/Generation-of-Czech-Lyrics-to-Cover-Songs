A MELANCHOLY thought had laid me low;
A thought of self-desertion, and the death
Of feelings wont with my heartâ€™s blood to flow,
And feed the inner soul with purest breath.
The idle busy star of daily life,
Base passions, haughty doubts, and selfish fears,
Have withered up my being in a strife
Unkind, and dried the source of human tears.
One evening I went forth, and stood alone
With Nature: moon there was not, nor the light
Of any star in heaven: yet from the sight
Of that dim nightfall better hope hath given
Upon my spirit, and from those cedars high
Solemnly changeless, as the very sky.
