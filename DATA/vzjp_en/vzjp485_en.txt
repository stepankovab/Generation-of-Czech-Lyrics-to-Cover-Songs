I TOOK A VOW

I took a vow of nakedness and hid inside my skin.
I took a vow of innocence; that was my gravest sin.
I took a vow of reverence. Whatever gods may be
Commanded me to trade it in on a vow of heresy.
I took a vow of mystery; that was my only clue.
I took a vow of abstinence from everything but you.

I took a vow of true and false; I was trying to hedge my bet.
I took a vow of yesterday. Is it tomorrow yet?
I took a vow of conquest, which is how I lost the war.
I think I took a vow of certainty, I can’t be sure.
I took a vow of clumsiness; you tripped me with your grace.
I learned to take a vow of ecstasy in your embrace.

I took a vow of torture, but I lost track of the pain.
I’d take a vow of lunacy if only I were sane.
I took a vow of recklessness; I did it on a dare.
I took a vow of suicide till I gave up on despair.
I vowed to take a million vows; in the end I took a few.
I took a vow of loneliness, but I reckoned without you.
