SHE HELD MY SHADOW GENTLY

She held my shadow gently,
Like a weakened, wither’d child  —
My own morose Madonna
Sighing sadly though she smiled.
My haggard head, in darkness,
press’d and heav’d beneath her breast,
Burrowed deep and nestled deeper,
Numb and naked in my nest.
As manic limbs and mangled mind,
All gutted yet … beguiled,
Felt death-pain, darkened, down-turned eyes
Wept warm and wet and mild.
Through weeping-open, willing flesh  —
While still she sweetly smiled  —
The ache slid snake-like into her,
And still she softly smiled.
