YOUR MOTHER KNOWS

Your mother knows the earth’s a plane
And, challenged, sheds a martyr’s tear.
God give her strength to bear this pain —
A child who says the world’s a sphere!

Challenged, she sheds a martyr’s tear.

By telling her the world’s a sphere.
It’s very bad to tell a lie.

It’s bad to think your mother odd.

All this has been ordained by God.

It’s hard to see what you can do.
Already people find you strange.

She’s praying, hoping you will change.
You’re difficult. You don’t fit in.

You know your anger is a sin.

You’re difficult. You don’t fit in.

You know your anger is a sin.
Your mother knows the earth’s a plane.
