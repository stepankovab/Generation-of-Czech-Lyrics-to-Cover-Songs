CATCHING FROGS

I caught a frog and showed it to my dad;
My dad was quite impressed with what I’d done.
He said, “That’s quite a frog you caught-not bad!
Although I thought you might catch more than one.”
So I went back and caught another frog
And then another, and another more.
I caught a dozen in a little bog.
I caught a dozen in the pond next-door.
I put them safe inside then went back out
To see how many more that I could find.
I don’t know what the screaming was about;
I didn’t think that anyone would mind.
I guess my mother didn’t want to share
Her bathtub with the frogs I put in there.
