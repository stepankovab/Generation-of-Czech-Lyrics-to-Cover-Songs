XXXIV

Like as a ship, that through the Ocean wide,
  by conduct of some star doth make her way,
  whenas a storm hath dimmed her trusty guide,
  out of her course doth wander far astray.
So I whose star, that wont with her bright ray,
  me to direct, with clouds is over-cast,
  do wander now, in darkness and dismay,
  through hidden perils round about me placed.
Yet hope I well, that when this storm is past,
  My Helice the lodestar of my life
  will shine again, and look on me at last,
  with lovely light to clear my cloudy grief.
Till then I wander carefull comfortless,
  in secret sorrow and sad pensiveness.
Why then should I accompt of little pain,
  that endless pleasure shall unto me gain.
