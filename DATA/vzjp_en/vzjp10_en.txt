XVIII

THE rolling wheel that runneth often round,
  The hardest steel in tract of time doth tear:
  and drizzling drops that often do redound,
  the firmest flint doth in continuance wear.
Yet cannot I with many a dropping tear,
  and long intreaty soften her hard heart:
  that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to hear,
  or look with pity on my painful smart.
But when I plead, she bids me play my part,
  and when I weep, she says tears are but water:
  and when I sigh, she says I know the art,
  and when I wail she turnes her self to laughter.
So do I weep, and wail, and plead in vain,
  whiles she as steel and flint doth still remain.
