LOVE IS MORE THICKER THAN FORGET

love is more thicker than forget
more thinner than recall
more seldom than a wave is wet
more frequent than to fail

it’s most mad and moonly
and less it shall unbe
than all the sea which only
is deeper than the sea

love is more always than to win
less never than alive
less bigger than the least begin
less litter than forgive

it’s most sane and sunly
and more it cannot die
than all the sky which only
is higher than the sky
