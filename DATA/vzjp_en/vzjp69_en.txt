MEDIOCRITY IN LOVE REJECTED

GIVE me more love or more disdain ;
The torrid or the frozen zone
Bring equal ease unto my pain,
The temperate affords me none :
Either extreme of love or hate,
Is sweeter than a calm estate.

Give me a storm ; if it be love,
Like Danaë in that golden shower,
I swim in pleasure ; if it prove
Disdain, that torrent will devour
My vulture-hopes ; and he’s possess’d
Of heaven, that’s but from hell released.
Then crown my joys or cure my pain :
Give me more love or more disdain.
