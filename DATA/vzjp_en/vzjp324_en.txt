APOLOGY

Why do I write today?

The beauty of
the terrible faces
of our nonentities
stirs me to it:

colored women
day workers –
old and experienced –
return home at dusk
in cast off clothing
faces like
old Florentine oak.

Also

the set pieces
of your faces stir me –
leading citizens-
but not in the same way.
