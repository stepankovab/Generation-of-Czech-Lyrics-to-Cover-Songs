“I’M AWAKE!”

I think I hear my mother call my name,
And so I roll my pillow on my head.
It’s morning once again, and who’s to blame?
Today I’ll just pretend that I am dead.
When mother takes the pillow from my face,
And pulls the blankets off to let me freeze,
I’m like a lump of glue that’s dried in place.
I think: Don’t blink, don’t move, don’t burp or sneeze.
But mother isn’t fooled as I fake death;
I must have played this game with her before.
That’s right, I did. I draw a sudden breath,
Remembering the water that she poured.
She poured it on my head, for goodness sake!
“I’m up! I’m up!” I call out, “I’m awake!”
