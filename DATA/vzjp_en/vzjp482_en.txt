A CURSE ON YOU

A curse on you: may all the desert djinns
who haunt dry wastelands be unbottled; may
they swirl into your home and make demands â€”
not grant three things but take three things away:
your wife, your kids, your cat; and then, for you,
bestow diarrhea in a dispensation
potent enough to carry the spell through
at least ten years of rank abomination.

A curse on you: may bedbugs swarm your sheets;
may you lose every game of chess you play;
may scorpions build nests down in the pleats
of your best easy chair; may more defeats
than the Detroit Lions piled up come your way.
May every flight you take see a delay.
