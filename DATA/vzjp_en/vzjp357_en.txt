SONNET CXXV

I too beneath your moon, almighty Sex,
go forth at nightfall crying like a cat,
leaving the lofty tower I laboured at
For birds to foul and boys and girls to vex
With tittering chalk; and you, and the long necks
Of neighbours sitting where their mothers sat
Are well aware of shadowy this and that
In me, thatâ€™s neither noble nor complex.

Such as I am however, I have brought
to what it is, this tower; it is my own;
though it was reared to Beauty, it was wrought
from what I had to build with: honest bone
is there, and anguish; pride and burning thought;
And lust is there, and nights not spent alone.
