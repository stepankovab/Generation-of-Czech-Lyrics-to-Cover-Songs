SONG

We are the darkness in the heat of the day,
The rootless flowers in the air, the coolness : we are the water
Lying upon the leaves before Death, our sun,
And its vast heat has drunken us … Beauty’s daughter
The heart of the rose and we are one.
We are the summer’s children, the breath of evening, the days
When all may be hoped for, — we are the unreturning
Smile of the lost one, seen through the summer leaves —
That sun and its false light scorning.
