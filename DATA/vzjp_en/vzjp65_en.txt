WHAT DOTH IT SERVE

What doth it serve to see sun’s burning face,
  And skies enamelled with both the Indies’ gold?
  Or moon at night in jetty chariot roll’d,
  And all the glory of that starry place?
What doth it serve earth’s beauty to behold,
  The mountain’s pride, the meadow’s flow’ry grace,
  The stately comeliness of forests old,
  The sport of floods which would themselves embrace?
What doth it serve to hear the sylvans’ songs,
  The wanton merle, the nightingale’s sad strains,
  Which in dark shades seem to deplore my wrongs?
For what doth serve all that this world contains,
    Sith she for whom those once to me were
dear,
    No part of them can have now with me
here?
