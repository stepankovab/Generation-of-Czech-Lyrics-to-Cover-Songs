1918

a family of gypsies
comes into the store
my mother and peg
are playing in the
back of the place
in a house of shoe
boxes my grand
father dark as a
gypsy and as sly
is naturally quite
suspicious tells
the clerks to button
their eyes my mother
is dreaming of fires
and tambourines
red skirts swirling
the old woman looks
at a shoe 4 people
are watching my grand
mother comes from
behind the handbags
and corsets the
old gypsy shrugs no
everyone breathes
easy as they go but
she comes back in
15 minutes with the
shoes like a cat
with a rabbit and
she says you were
all watching me so
I had to prove I
could now they're
yours
