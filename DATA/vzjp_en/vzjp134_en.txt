SUMMER MOODS

I love at even-tide to walk alone,
Down narrow lanes, o’erhung with dewy thorn,
Where, from the long grass underneath, the snail,
Jet black, creeps out, and sprouts his timid horn.
I love to muse o’er meadows newly mown,
Where withering grass perfumes the sultry air;
Where bees search round, with sad and weary drone,
In vain, for flowers that bloomed but newly there;
While in the juicy corn the hidden quail
Cries “Wet my foot!”; and, hid as thoughts unborn,
The fairy-like and seldom-seen land-rail
Utters “Craik, craik”, like voices underground:
Right glad to meet the evening’s dewy veil,
And see the light fade into glooms around.
