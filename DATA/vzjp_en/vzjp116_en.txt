DEFENCE OF FORT McHENRY*
(The Star-Spangled Banner)

O say can you see by the dawn’s early light
What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes & bright stars through the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watch’d, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket’s red glare, the bomb bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free & the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream
’Tis the star-spangled banner — O long may it wave
O’er the land of the free & the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,
That the havoc of war & the battle’s confusion
A home & a Country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling & slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free & the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war’s desolation!
Blest with vict’ry & peace, may the heav’n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made & preserv’d us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto — “In God is our trust.”
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free & the home of the brave.
