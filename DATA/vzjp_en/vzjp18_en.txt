LIX

Deere, why make you more of a dog then me?
If he doe loue, I burne, I burne in loue;
If he waite well, I neuer thence would moue;
If he be faire, yet but a dog can be;
  Little he is, so little worth is he;
He barks, my songs thine owne voyce oft doth proue;
Bidden, perhaps he fetched thee a gloue,
But I, vnbid, fetch euen my soule to thee.
Yet, while I languish, him that bosome clips,
  That lap doth lap, nay lets, in spite of spite,
This sowre-breath’d mate taste of those sugred lips.
Alas, if you graunt onely such delight
    To witlesse things, then Loue, I hope
(since wit
    Becomes a clog) will soone ease me of it.
