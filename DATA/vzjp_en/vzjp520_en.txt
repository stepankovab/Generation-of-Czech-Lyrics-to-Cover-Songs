VALEDICTORY

Thank you, friends, for this splendid pocket watch,
Who knew that real silver was so bright?
And better still the fancy flask of scotch
My wife and I will toast you well tonight!
I might have known that handsome captain’s chair
Was waiting for me out there in the hall.
And this old photo from when I had hair
Will find a place of honor on my wall!
You all have meant so much to me, each day,
Each minute, of these thirty-seven years.
And, heavens, all these gifts…What can I say?
Just “Thank you” any more and I’d risk tears.
I fear it’s all too much for an old man;
I would have settled for a pension plan.
