THE SONNET

Pure form, that like some chalice of old time
 Contain’st the liquid of the poet’s thought
 Within thy curving hollow, gem-enwrought
 With interwoven traceries of rhyme,
While o’er thy brim the bubbling fancies climb,
 What thing am I, that undismayed have sought
 To pour my verse with trembling hand untaught
 Into a shape so small yet so sublime?
Because perfection haunts the hearts of men,
 Because thy sacred chalice gathered up
 The wine of Petrarch, Shakspere, Shelley — then
Receive these tears of failure as they drop
 (Sole vintage of my life), since I am fain
 To pour them in a consecrated cup.
