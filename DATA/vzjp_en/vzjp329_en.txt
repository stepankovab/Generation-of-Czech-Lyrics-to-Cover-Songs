TO WOMEN AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED

The feelings I don’t have I don’t have.
The feeling I don’t have, I won’t say I have.
The feelings you say you have, you don’t have.
The feelings you would like us both to have, we neither of us have.
The feelings people ought to have, they never have.
If people say they’ve got feelings, you may be pretty sure they haven’t got them.
So if you want either of us to feel anything at all
You’d better abandon all ideas of feelings altogether.
