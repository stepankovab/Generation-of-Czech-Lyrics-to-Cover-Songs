ILLUSION

I wish to wash away in blue washed light.
See how the seagulls fade while still in sight,
one moment near, then gone. They disappear
and yet we know theyâ€™re there. The sky is clear
but white turns blue. The empty view declares
a sleight of eye. They vanish unawares.
So life betrays our sense of permanence.
We shift to past while in the present tense.
