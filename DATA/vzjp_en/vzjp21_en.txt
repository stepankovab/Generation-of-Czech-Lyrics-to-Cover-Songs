EPITAPH

Even such is tyme, which takes in trust
Our youth, our joyes, and all wee have.
And payes us but with age & dust,
Within the darke & silent grave:
When wee have wandred all our wayes,
Shuttes up the story of our dayes.
And from which death, & grave, & dust,
The Lord will rayse mee up I trust.
