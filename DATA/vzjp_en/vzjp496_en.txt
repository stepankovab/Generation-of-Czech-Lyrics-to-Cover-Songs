WHAT WOULD SANTA CLAUS SAY

What would Santa Claus say,
I wonder,
about Jesus returning
to kill and plunder?

For Heâ€™ll likely return
on Christmas day
to blow the bad
little boys away!

When He flashes like lightning
across the skies
and many a homosexual
dies,

when the harlots and heretics
are ripped asunder,
what will the Easter Bunny think,
I wonder?
