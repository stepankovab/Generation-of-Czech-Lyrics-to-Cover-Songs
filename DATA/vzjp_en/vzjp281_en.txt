DISARMAMENT

One spake amid the nations, “Let us cease
From darkening with strife the fair World’s light,
We who are great in war be great in peace.
No longer let us plead the cause by might.”

But from a million British graves took birth
A silent voice — the million spake as one  —
“If ye have righted all the wrongs of earth
Lay by the sword!  Its work and ours is done.”
