OFF TO OUTER SPACE TOMORROW MORNING

You can start the Count Down, you can take a last look;
You can pass me my helmet from its plastic hook;
You can cross out my name in the telephone book  —
For I’m off to Outer Space tomorrow morning.
There won’t be any calendar, there won’t be any clock;
Daylight will be on the switch and winter under lock.
I’ll doze when I’m sleepy and wake without a knock  —
For I’m off to Outer Space tomorrow morning.
I’ll be writing no letters; I’ll be posting no mail.
For with nobody to visit me and not a friend in hail,
In solit’ry confinement as complete as any gaol
I’ll be off to Outer Space tomorrow morning.

    When my capsule door is sealed and my
space-flight has begun,
    With the teacups circling round me like
the planets round the sun,
    I’ll be centre of my gravity, a universe
of one,
    Setting off to Outer Space tomorrow
morning.
    You can watch on television and follow
from afar,
    Tracking through your telescope my
upward shooting star,
    But you needn’t think I’ll give a damn
for you or what you are
    When I’m off to Outer Space tomorrow
morning.
    And when the rockets thrust me on my
trans-galactic hop,
    With twenty hundred light-years before
the first stop,
    Then you and every soul on earth can go
and blow your top  —
    For I’m off to Outer Space tomorrow
morning.
