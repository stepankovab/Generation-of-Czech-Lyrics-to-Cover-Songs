MY TRUE LOVE HATH MY HEART AND I HAVE
HIS

My true-love hath my heart, and I have his,
By just exchange, one for the other giv’n.
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;
There never was a better bargain driv’n.
    His heart in me keeps me and him in one,
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides;
He loves my heart, for once it was his own;
I cherish his, because in me it bides.
    His heart his wound received from my
sight:
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;
For as from me, on him his hurt did light,
So still me thought in me his hurt did smart:
    Both equal hurt, in this change sought
our bliss:
    My true love hath my heart and I have
his.
