LOUISIANA BROKE MY SLEEP

Louisiana broke my sleep this morning,
and drew me down her autumn waterways.
The cypress moss a-sway, the bayou yawning,
Louisiana broke my sleep this morning.
White egrets fell across the sunscape dawning
as into skies of humid coral haze,
Louisiana broke my sleep this morning,
and drew me down her autumn waterways.
