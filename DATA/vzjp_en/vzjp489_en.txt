I LIKE YOU THE BEST

Of all my readers I like you the best.
You’re sexily well-read, and very smart —
Oh, you’re the one; the rest are just the rest.

Though most of them will think I speak in jest,
It’s you, you know, who’s read into my heart:
Of all my readers I like you the best.

I’m feeling better now that I’ve confessed
That it’s for you I struggle with my art.
You are the one — the rest are just the rest.

I see by your reaction you had guessed
I liked you more, and liked you from the start;
Of all my readers, I like you the best.

You get me — and I like how you’re impressed
That I know Horace comes before Descartes;
Ah, you’re the one. The rest are just the rest.

I like you very much — I’d be distressed
At anything that kept us two apart.
Of all my readers I like you the best;
Yes, you’re the one: the rest are just the rest.
