135

WHo ever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,
And Will too boote, and Will in over-plus,
More then enough am I that vexe thee still,
To thy sweet will making addition thus.
Wilt thou whose will is large and spatious,
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine,
Shall will in others seeme right gracious,
And in my will no faire acceptance shine:
The sea all water, yet receives raine still,
And in aboundance addeth to his store,
So thou beeing rich in Will adde to thy Will,
One will of mine to make thy large Will more.
    Let no unkinde, no faire beseechers kill,
    Thinke all but one, and me in that one
Will.
