FLIGHT PATH

Yesterday, you smeared your blood across
The pane and dropped, neck broken, to the grass.
I plastic bagged your feathered corpse to toss
It in the trash. I spritzed and wiped the glass.
The clean-up chore was small. Likewise the loss?

Another robin hopping on the lawn
This morning hardly seems to be aware,
Much less to feel unsettled, that you’re gone.
He’s not the one who put the window there.
