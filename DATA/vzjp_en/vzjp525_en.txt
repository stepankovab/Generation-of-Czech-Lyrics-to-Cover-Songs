THE PHILOSOPHER DRINKS STARBUCKS

The young philosopher is very bright,
contradicting what he does and says.
He drinks his Starbucks coffee day and night.

A college student, upper class and white,
he speaks of corporation’s evil ways.
The young philosopher is very bright.

He studies Marx and Engels with delight
and shouts by rote their every word and phrase.
He drinks his Starbucks coffee day and night.

He rants how Lenin was so very right:
“Capitalism’s just a passing phase!”
The young philosopher is very bright.

He loves the down and out, this Trotskyite,
but not the trash who live on mayonnaise.
He drinks his Starbucks coffee day and night.

Yet, come spring break he’ll drive off in the light
to a mansion and an orchard full of rays.
The young philosopher is very bright.
He drinks his Starbucks coffee day and night.
