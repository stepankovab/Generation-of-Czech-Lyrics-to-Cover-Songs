Translation of: Huang O (1498 — 1569)
TO THE TUNE OF “SOARING CLOUDS”

You held my lotus blossom in your hand
So gently, and you played a marvelous game,
Your lips upon the pistil. When I came,
We took some rhino horn, and my demand
For more and more received no reprimand.
You fucked me all night long! You had no shame!
All night the rooster’s gorgeous crest, in flame,
Stood up, bright red. As bees in flowers stand
And gather nectar, you were lodged in me,
And trembled at my stamens, perfumed jewel.
So you shall have my all. It would be cruel
For someone else to plumb my lotus pond.
You make my blossoms fire with love so fond
And passion deeper than the eastern sea.
