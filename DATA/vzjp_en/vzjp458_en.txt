ASHES AND STRAW

Hell is my heart when sunny bluster blows.
Hot caterwauling, fulminating wails,
and blazing light beats everything that grows,

bleaching the empty shells of fossil snails.
Our noisy love where we two actors sparredâ€¦
hot caterwauling, fulminating wails;

and see my heart is crazed with grief and scarred
by warring love that crushed into a shade,
our noisy love where we two actors sparred,

a Beatrice and Benedict who played
opponents trapped together in a bond,
by warring love that crushed into a shade,

and never telling how we two were fond.
Ashes and straw now swirl around my head;
opponents trapped together in a bond.

And now the world is brittle, dry and dead.
Hell is my heart when sunny bluster blows.
Ashes and straw now swirl around my head
and blazing light beats everything that grows.
