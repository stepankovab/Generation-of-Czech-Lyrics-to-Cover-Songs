BECAUSE

Because the cougar cracks the antelope,
Because the weak hawk chick’s pushed from its nest
To spare scarce meat that nourishes the strong,
Because we kill for love and food, I place blind hope
In blind, impersonal acceptance of all wrong,
Knowing remorse can lacerate the breast
Of those who’d redesign their hungry wills
Because the weak hawk chick’s pushed from its nest.
Nature’s serene indifference is a curse
Only to those who fail to feel sublimity
In transformations of late light that spills
On purple mountains or green frothing sea,
Mindless magnificence, and, worse,
Demanding some redeeming purpose kills
The dazed beholder’s blazing joy, and kills blind hope,
Because the cougar cracks the antelope.
