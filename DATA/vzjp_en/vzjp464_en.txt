MEMOIRS OF A FALLEN BLACKBIRD

They liked me when I was on the wing
And I could whistle and I could sing;
But now that I am in my bed of clay
They come no more for to be with me.

It was on the main road half-way between
Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale;
A juggernaut glanced me as it passed me by
And that was the end of the line for me.

Later that day, as I lay on the verge,
A thin rake of a man picked me up
Into his trembling hands, and he stared
At me full quarter of an hour, he stared.

At me then laid me down
And with his hands scooped me a shallow grave;
His soul passed into me as he coverd me o’er
I fear for him now where’er he be.

They liked me when I was on the wing
And I could whistle and I could sing;
But now that I am in my bed of clay
They come no more for to be with me.
