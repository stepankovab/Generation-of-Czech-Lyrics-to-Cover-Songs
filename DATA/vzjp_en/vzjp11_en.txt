XXVI

SWEET is the Rose, but grows upon a brere;
  Sweet is the Juniper, but sharp his bough;
  sweet is the Eglantine, but pricketh near;
  sweet is the firbloom, but his branches rough.
Sweet is the Cypress, but his rind is tough,
  sweet is the nut, but bitter is his pill;
  sweet is the broom-flower, but yet sour enough;
  and sweet is Moly, but his root is ill.
So every sweet with sour is tempered still,
  that maketh it be coveted the more:
  for easy things that may be got at will,
  most sorts of men do set but little store.
