EX CATHEDRA

Some poets wallow in the mood
Of vagueness and incertitude.
They pride themselves on hesitation,
Nuanced grays, and vacillation.
They think that ambiguity
Is proof of true nobility,
And atmospheres of muddled murk
Add cachet to their highbrow work.
These little whining schmucks insist
On verse that’s thick with fog and mist.
Their poems have the deadpan stare
Of some shrink sitting in a chair,
Stiff in unresponsive silence,
Unmoved by joy or grief or violence.

Just an image- nothing more!
A dish of plums, an open door!
Some chickens by a red wheelbarrow,
A glance- a touch- a broken arrow!

That is the way these assholes think.
They want to take you to the brink
Of some unspoken, vague suggestion
And leave you with a hanging question.
If you object “I just don’t see-”
They’ll answer with ferocity:

It’s questioning, and not conviction
That ought to shape poetic diction!
You have to leave things open-ended-
Not slammed shut, like a well defended
Fort, where every single entry
Is guarded by a zealous sentry!

I’ve got news for these boring pricks:
The verse-game is a bag of tricks.
You reach inside, pull out a rabbit,
And then with practice, it’s a habit.
But what you pull out must be clear
Of any smudge or blur or smear
That renders what you’re saying cryptic,
Vaporous, oblique, elliptic,
Hazy, muddy, or uncertain.
You’re there to PULL ASIDE the curtain
And not raise questions for debate.
Why write at all, unless to state
Straightforwardly the things you know?
To which these poets whisper low:

Our art’s a process wherein we
Seek to unfold dubiety.
We are uncertain and conflicted.
Our knowledge is unsure, restricted-
We have no liking or endurance
For dogmatism’s self-assurance!

And that’s why navel-gazing tripe
Flourishes and waxes ripe
In all the little quarterlies
Like cherries hanging from the trees;
Why clouds of ghostly apparitions
Plague and haunt small press editions;
Why stupor and hypnotic coma
Give poetry a bad aroma.
How can poets break the spell?
Now hear this, and hear it well:
If you’ve got nothing clear to say
Just shut your trap and go away.
Argue doubts with God and men,
But don’t pick up the sacred pen.
