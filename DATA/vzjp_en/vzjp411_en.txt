O WHAT IS THAT SOUND

O what is that sound which so thrills the ear
     Down in the valley drumming,
drumming?
 Only the scarlet soldiers, dear,
    The soldiers coming.

 O what is that light I see flashing so clear
     Over the distance brightly,
brightly?
 Only the sun on their weapons, dear,
     As they step lightly.

 O what are they doing with all that gear,
     What are they doing this
morning, this morning?
 Only their usual manoeuvres, dear.
     Or perhaps a warning.

 O why have they left the road down there,
     Why are they suddenly
wheeling, wheeling?
 Perhaps a change in their orders, dear.
     Why are you kneeling?

 O haven’t they stopped for the doctor’s care,
     Haven’t they reined their
horses, their horses?
 Why, they are none of them wounded, dear.
     None of these forces.

 O is it the parson they want, with white hair,
     Is it the parson, is it, is it?
 No, they are passing his gateway, dear,
     Without a visit.

 O it must be the farmer who lives so near.
     It must be the farmer so
cunning, so cunning?
 They have passed the farmyard already, dear,
     And now they are running.

 O where are you going? Stay with me here!
     Were the vows you swore
deceiving, deceiving?
 No, I promised to love you, dear,
     But I must be leaving.

 O it’s broken the lock and splintered the door,
     O it’s the gate where they’re
turning, turning;
 Their boots are heavy on the floor
     And their eyes are burning.
