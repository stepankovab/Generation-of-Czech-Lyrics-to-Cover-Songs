A RECOLLECTION

My father’s friend came once to tea.
He laughed and talked. He spoke to me.
But in another week they said
That friendly pink-faced man was dead.
‘How sad …’ they said, ‘the best of men …’
So I said too, ‘How sad’; but then
Deep in my heart I thought with pride,
‘I know a person who has died.’
