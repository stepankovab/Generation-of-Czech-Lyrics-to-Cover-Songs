AN ACADEMY PAINTER JUDGES THE
IMPRESSIONISTS

Impressionists? Their palettes are ablaze
With upstart colors heretofore unseen.
The lack of expert drafting makes for haze
And blurring in their polychromic scheme:
Puce, lemon, antique rose, and tangerine;
Cinnabar shading into umber hints;
Streaks of a velvet peridotal green
Speckled with azure flecks and ruby tints.
Sienna strokes are stabbed with yellow glints
Of golden fire, while a violet hue
Bleeds into ochre patches; orange sprints
In flashes across lilac and soft blue.
Not unexpected â€” once you banish line
Color runs riot like an unpruned vine.
