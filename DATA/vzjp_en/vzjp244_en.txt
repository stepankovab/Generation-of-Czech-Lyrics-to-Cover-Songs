YONDER SEE THE MORNING

Yonder see the morning blink:
     The sun is up, and up must I,
To wash and dress and eat and drink
And look at things and talk and think
     And work, and God knows why.

Oh often have I washed and dressed
     And what’s to show for all my
pain?
Let me lie abed and rest:
Ten thousand times I’ve done my best
     And all’s to do again.
