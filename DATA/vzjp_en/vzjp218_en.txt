THE MAD GARDENER’S SONG

He thought he saw an Elephant that practised on a fife:
He looked again, and found it was a letter from his wife.
“At length I realize,” he said, “The bitterness of Life!”

He thought he saw a Buffalo upon the chimney-piece:
He looked again, and found it was his Sister’s Husband’s Niece.
“Unless you leave this house,” he said, “I’ll send for the Police!”

He thought he saw a Rattlesnake that questioned him in Greek:
He looked again, and found it was The Middle of Next Week.
“The one thing I regret,” he said, “is that it cannot speak!”

He thought he saw a Banker’s Clerk descending from the ‘bus:
He looked again, and found it was a Hippopotamus.
“If this should stay to dine,” he said, “There won’t be much for us!”

He thought he saw a Kangaroo that worked a coffee-mill:
He looked again, and found it was a Vegetable-Pill.
“Were I to swallow this,” he said, “I should be very ill!”

He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four that stood beside his bed:
He looked again, and found it was a Bear without a Head.
“Poor thing,” he said, “poor silly thing! It’s waiting to be fed!”

He thought he saw an Albatross that fluttered round the lamp:
He looked again, and found it was a Penny-Postage-Stamp.
“You’d best be getting home,” he said, “The nights are very damp!”

He thought he saw a Garden-Door that opened with a key:
He looked again, and found it was a Double Rule of Three:
“And all its mystery,” he said, “is clear as day to me!”

He thought he saw an Argument that proved he was the Pope:
He looked again, and found it was a Bar of Mottled Soap.
“A fact so dread,” he faintly said, “extinguishes all hope!”
