CONVENT CATS

Ye shall not possess any beast, my
dear sisters, except only a cat.
 —  The Ancren Riwle (Rule for Nuns)

Part of it was practical, no doubt:
you had to have a cat to kill the mice
inside the convent. However devout
and tenderhearted, women will think twice
of tolerating vermin. Yet there’s more
to explain why dogs or birds were not allowed
but cats permitted past the cloister door,
amid those virgin women, triple-vowed.
Cats might go out at night to rut and screw,
but how deeply or greatly involved
with sin, they could trot innocent into
those corridors of chastity, absolved,
self-pardoned of crimes done the night before,
and rub their backs against the vestry door.
