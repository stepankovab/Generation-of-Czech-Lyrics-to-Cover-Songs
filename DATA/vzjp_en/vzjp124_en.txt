IF THAT HIGH WORLD

If that high world — which lies beyond
Our own, surviving love endears;
If there the cherished heart be fond,
The eye the same — except in tears  —
How welcome those untrodden spheres!
How sweet this very hour to die!
To soar from earth and find all fears
Lost in thy light — eternity!

It must be so — ’tis not for self
That we so tremble on the brink,
And striving to o’erleap the gulph,
Yet cling to Being’s breaking link.
Oh! in that future let us think
To hold each heart the heart that shares;
With them the immortal waters drink,
And soul in soul grow deathless theirs!
