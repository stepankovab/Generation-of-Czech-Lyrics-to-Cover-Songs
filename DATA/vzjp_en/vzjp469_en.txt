STRUGNELL’S SONNET

Not only marble, but the plastic toys
From cornflake packets will outlive this rhyme
I can’t immortalize you, love — our joys
Will lie unnoticed in the vault of time.
When Mrs. Thatcher has been cast in bronze
And her administration is a page
In some O-Level text-book, when the dons
Have analysed the story of our age,
When travel firms sell tours of outer space
When aeroplanes take off without a sound
And Tulse Hill has become a trendy place
And upper Norwood’s on the underground
Your beauty and my name will be forgotten  —
My love is true, but all my verse is rotten.
