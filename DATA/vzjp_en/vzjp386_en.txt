THE INTRUSION

Going confidently into the garden
Where she made much of you four hours ago
You find another person in her seat.

If your scalp crawls and your eyes prick at sight
Of her white motionless face and folded hands
Framed in such thunderclouds of sorrow,

Give her no word of consolation, man,
Dissemble your own anguish,
Withdraw in silence, gaze averted â€“

This is the dark edge of her double-axe:
Divine mourning for what cannot be.
