THINK’ST THOU TO SEDUCE ME THEN ?

Think’st thou to seduce me then with words that have no meaning ?
Parrats so can learne to prate, our speech by pieces gleaning :
Nurces teach their children so about the time of weaning.

Learne to speake first, then to wooe : to wooing, much pertayneth :
Hee that courts us, wanting Arte, soone falters when he fayneth,
Lookes asquint on his discourse, and smiles, when hee complaineth.

Skilfull Anglers hide their hookes, fit baytes for every season ;
But with crooked pins fish thou, as babes doe, that want reason :
Gogions onely can be caught with such poore trickes of treason.

Ruth forgive me, if I err’d from humane heart’s compassion,
When I laught sometimes too much to see thy foolish fashion :
But, alas, who lesse could doe that found so good occasion ?
