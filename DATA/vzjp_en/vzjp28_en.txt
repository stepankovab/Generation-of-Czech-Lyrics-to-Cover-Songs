XXI

A witlesse Gallant, a young Wench that woo’d,
(Yet his dull Spirit her not one iot could moue)
Intreated me, as e’r I wish’d his good,
To write him but one Sonnet to his Loue:
When I, as fast as e’r my Penne could trot,
Powr’d out what first from quicke Inuention came;
Nor neuer stood one word thereof to blot,
Much like his Wit, that was to vse the same:
But with my Verses he his Mistres wonne,
Who doted on the Dolt beyond all measure.
But see, for you to Heau’n for Phraze I runne,
And ransacke all Apollo’s golden Treasure;
   Yet by my Froth, this Foole his Loue obtaines,
   And I lose you, for all my Wit and Paines.
