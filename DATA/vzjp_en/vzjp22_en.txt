SONNET 19

My Hart impos’d this penance on mine eies,
(Eies the first causers of my harts lamenting):
That they should weepe till love and fancie dies,
Fond love the last cause of my harts repenting.
Mine eies upon my hart inflict this paine,
(Bold hart that dard to harbour thoughts of love)
That it should love and purchase fell disdaine,
A grievous penance which my hart doth prove.
Mine eies did weepe as hart had them imposed,
My hart did pine as eies had it constrained:
Eies in their teares my paled face disclosed,
Hart in his sighs did show it was disdained.
So th’one did weepe th’other sighed, both grieved,
For both must live and love, both unrelieved.
