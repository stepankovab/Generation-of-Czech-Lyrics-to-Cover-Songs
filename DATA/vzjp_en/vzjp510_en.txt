SONNET

In the old age, black was not counted fair …


The world knows black as universal sin.
No Paris stylist passionately swearing
The chic are rendered chicer, thin more thin,
Persuades the bon vivant into its wearing.
In black, the child is chased away, affection
And understanding, though it clothe demurely;
Compassion, color run from the complexion.
But since life thrives through compromises, surely
Let raven, sable, rook be my disguise.
Make murk my brow, in ashes root my hair,
That while I live, none but my master’s eyes
May gain one aureole to find me fair,
And thereby — in fair finding — obfuscate
My mirror’s counter and uncountered mate.
