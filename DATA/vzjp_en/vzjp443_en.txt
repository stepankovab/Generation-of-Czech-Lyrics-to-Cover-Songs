DELAY

The radiance of the star that leans on me
Was shining years ago. The light that now
Glitters up there my eyes may never see,
And so the time lag teases me with how
Love that loves now may not reach me until
Its first desire is spent. The starâ€™s impulse
Must wait for eyes to claim it beautiful
And love arrived may find us somewhere else.
