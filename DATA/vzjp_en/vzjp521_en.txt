THIS IS ONE OF THOSE POEMS

This is one of those poems
without any rhymes,
of the kind you may read
in the Sunday TimesGuardian.

For the real poet, you see,
rhymeâ€™s deleterious,
when you want to be seen
as poignant and seriousprofound.

Rhyme trivialises;
it smacks of the frivolous.
If you must rhyme at all,
make it less ridiculousobvious

This is also one of those poems
you hope might say something insightful
about the human condition
but then just kind of ends.
