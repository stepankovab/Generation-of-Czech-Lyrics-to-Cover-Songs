ANNUAL MEETING

Except for that blip in our earnings this year,
This company’s stronger that ever before.
As shareholders you will have nothing to fear.
We’re losing some battles, but winning the war.

The SEC experts have come to explore
How two billion dollars could just disappear.
We’d never have let them get past the front door,
Except for that blip in our earnings this year.

Another few months and we’ll be in the clear.
We’ll lay off some workers and close down a store.
What I’m telling you now is completely sincere,
This company’s stronger than ever before.

Insolvency hearings are just a big bore,
And never as bad as they first appear.
The writs of foreclosure we’ll simply ignore.
As shareholders, you will have nothing to fear.

Our cash flow position is not that severe.
Though we can’t cover payroll, we’re sound at the core,
Don’t rush to believe the first news that you hear,
We’re losing some battles, but winning the war.

Now at the request of this firm I adore
I’ve found new employment, a long way from here.
I’m really not sure what they’re sacking me for,
The company prospered throughout my career  —
Except for that blip.
