MODERN POET

This is no moment now for the fine phrases,
The inflated sentence, words cunningly spun,
For the floreate image or the relaxing pun
Or the sentimental answer that most pleases.

We must write down an age of reckless hunger,
Of iron girders, hearts like plumb-lines hung
And the poetâ€™s art is to speak and not to be sung
And sympathy must turn away to anger.
