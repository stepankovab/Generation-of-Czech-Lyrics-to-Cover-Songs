XLVIII

INNOCENT paper whom too cruel hand,
  Did make the matter to avenge her ire:
  and ere she could thy cause well understand,
  did sacrifice unto the greedy fire.
Well worthy thou to have found better hire,
  then so bad end for heretics ordained:
  yet heresy nor treason didst conspire,
  but plead thy masters cause unjustly pained.
Whom all the careless of his grief constrained
  to utter forth th’ anguish of his heart:
  and would not hear, when he to her complained,
  the piteous passion of his dying smart.
Yet live for ever, though against her will,
  and speak her good, though she requite it ill.
