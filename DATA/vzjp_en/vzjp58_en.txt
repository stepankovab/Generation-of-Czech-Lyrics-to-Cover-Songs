II — TO MY BOOK

It will be look’d for, BOOK, when some but see
    Thy title, EPIGRAMS, and named of me,
Thou shouldst be bold, licentious, full of gall,
    Wormwood, and sulphur, sharp, and
tooth’d withal ;
Become a petulent thing, hurl ink, and wit,
    As madmen stones ; not caring
whom they hit.
Deceive their malice, who could wish it so ;
    And by thy wiser temper, let men know
Thou art not so covetous of least self-fame,
    Made from the hazard of another’s shame ;
Much less, with lewd, profane, and beastly phrase,
    To catch the world’s loose laughter, or
vain gaze.
He that departs with his own honesty
    For vulgar praise, doth it too dearly
buy.
