BIRTHDAY SOUP

“If soup is what you want, then soup you’ll get.”
I still recall my mom’s indifferent voice
When I announced my mind was firmly set
On shunning cake, the normal birthday choice.
Iconoclast, I thought as I chose soup,
Like Joan of Arc (a heretic to some).
I’d force the baker’s army to regroup;
The soup-day revolution had begun!
But looking back I see my fatal flaw;
I see what made my friends all laugh and mock.
It must have been the end my mom foresaw
As she prepared that fateful birthday stock.
A wish-less birthday soup was all I got
As all the candles sank into the pot.
