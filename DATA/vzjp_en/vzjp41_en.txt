ALL KINDE OF WRONGE ALLACE! …

All kinde of wronge allace! it now aboundes
And honestie is fleemed out of this land
Now trumprie over trueth his triumphe soundes
Who now can knowe the hart by tongue or hand
Cummes ever justice at the barre to stande
Where can she be in these our later dayes
Alike in water for to wagg a wande
As speare for her if truelie sundrie sayes
For manie now abroade doe daylie blaize
That justice hath her hart infected sore
How can she then be cleane in anie wayes
Bot must become corrupted more and more
Sume lockman now hath locked up apart
Poore justice martyr’d with a meschant hart.
