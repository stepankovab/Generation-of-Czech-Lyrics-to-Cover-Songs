WAITING

I wait and wait and wait and wait some more;
I wish my friend would come so we could play.
I wait and wait and wait; it’s such a bore
And such an awful way to spend the day.
I sit and wait but nothing seems to change
Except the sun, which moves across the sky
I sit and wait; it seems a little strange
To sit and watch the day go slowly by.
I think of all the games I might have played
And all the books I think I could have read.
I think of building, things I might have made
And all the waiting I have done instead.
So while there’s still at least a little sun
I’ll go outside and have a little fun.
