VERSAILLES BALLADE

The morning beams steal down the field of Mars.
The streets, awash in soap suds, smell of sage.
The people march to work, a few in cars,
and some on cycles pedal to their wage.
I pull the coverlet, roll my ribcage
towards one corner of the mattress, lie
composed as any corpse, and disengage.
I have made love in Paris. Let me die.

Aurora, Mars beside, pours out her jars,
with gravity his gun, and time his swage,
illuminating brasseries and bars,
the rooftops of Grand Garnier’s opera stage.
Fed on tartelettes of the Chartreuse gage,
I have seen queens’ swans, moved a man to cry,
heard Bach played in the Metro on guitars.
I have made love in Paris. Let me die.

Though this same sunlight reaches me, and wars
against my body, forcing it to age,
outlining its deficiencies, its scars
become italic, as upon a page,
I shall not let its insolence enrage,
but blankly only wonder with a sigh.
There is no longing left here to assuage.
I have made love in Paris. Let me die.

Revered and royal phantoms–shahs, kings, czars
forever overshadowing Versailles
through mirrored hallways: hear me from the stars!
I have made love in Paris. Let me die.
