How strange
This feeling that my life's begun at last
This change Can people fall in love so fast

What's the matter with you, Cosette
Have you been too much on your own
So many things unclear
So many things unknown

In my life
Ever so many questions
and answers
That somehow seems wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of the faraway song
And it sings Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach
Just a whisper away
waiting for me

Does he know I'm alive
Do I know if he's real
Does he see what I see
Does he feel what I feel

In my life
I'm no longer alone Now the love in my life is so near
Find me now
Find me here

Dear Cosette You're such  a lonely child
How pensive, how sad you seem to me
Believe me
Were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be
I can see
With only me for company

There's so little I know that I'm longing to know
Of the man that you were in a time long ago

There's so little you say of the life you have known
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone
So dark, so dark and deep
The secrets that you keep

In my life
Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good
But Papa
Dear Papa
In your eyes I am still like the child
Who's lost in a wood

No more words
No more words it's a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard,
better unsaid

In my life
I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years, Years ago

In my life
She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun
And my life
Seems to stop as if something is over And something has scarcely begun

Eponine You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you I am at one with the gods
And Heaven is near
And I soar through a world that is new that is free

Every word that he says is a dagger in me
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere, where he is
If he asked

In my life
In my life
