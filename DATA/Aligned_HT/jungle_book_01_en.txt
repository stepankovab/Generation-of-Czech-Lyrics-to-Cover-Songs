Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder
of my big home
The bees are buzzin'
in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants

The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you

And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
