A ghost you say, a ghost maybe
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, then she was gone

I am agog
I am aghast
Is Marius
in love at last
I've never heard him 'ooh' and 'aah'
You talk of battles to be won
And here he comes like Don Juan
It's better than an opera

It is time for us all To decide who we are
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now
Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay
Is this simply a game
For a rich young boy to play
The colours of the world
Are changing day by day

Red
the blood of angry men
Black
the dark of ages past
Red
a world about to dawn
Black
the night that ends at last

Had you seen her today
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight
Had you been there today
You might also have known
How your world may be changed
In just one burst of light
And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right

Red
I feel my soul on fire
Black
My world if she's not there
Red
It's the colour of desire
Black
It's the colour of despair

Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call
Who cares about your lonely soul
We strive towards a larger goal
Our little lives don't count at all

Red
the blood of angry men
Black
the dark of ages past
Red
a world about to dawn
Black
the night that ends at last
